# Neural-Network-Python-Implementation

This repository provides a detailed, step-by-step implementation of a Neural Network in Python, specifically designed to solve the XOR problem. The code is built entirely from scratch, focusing on core concepts like:

* **Network Architecture:** Building a simple neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
* **Activation Function:** Implementing the sigmoid activation function to introduce non-linearity into the network's predictions.
* **Forward Propagation:** Calculating the weighted sum of inputs at each layer and applying the activation function.
* **Backpropagation:** Understanding the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the network's weights and biases based on the error in its predictions.
* **Weight and Bias Updates:** Implementing the logic to update the weights and biases during training to improve the network's performance.

**Learning Resources and Benefits:**

This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the fundamentals of Neural Networks from a practical perspective. By following the well-commented code and explanations, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:

* How neural networks process information.
* The role of backpropagation in training neural networks.
* The impact of weight and bias values on network performance.

**Target Audience:**

This repository is geared towards:

* Beginners in Machine Learning who want to grasp the basics of Neural Networks.
* Python programmers interested in exploring the practical implementation of neural network concepts.
* Anyone curious about how neural networks tackle the XOR problem.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code focuses on a single hidden layer network for the XOR problem. You can explore extensions for more complex architectures in future contributions.
